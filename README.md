Running locally
---------------

Run `com.danielflower.apprunner.RunLocal.main` from your IDE. This will use the settings in
`sample-config.properties` and download apps specified in `sample-repo-list.txt` which can
be useful for local development.

Configuration
-------------

See `sample-config.properties` for configuration information. Each setting can be specified
as an environment variable, a java system property, or in a properties file who's path is
specified as a command line argument.
